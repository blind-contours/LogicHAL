\title{LogicHAL: Iterative Tree Building and Lasso Fitting}
\usage{
LogicHAL(data, outcome, columns, max_trees = 5, max_depth = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the features and the outcome variable.}

\item{outcome}{A character string specifying the name of the outcome variable.}

\item{columns}{A character string indicating which columns to construct logic interactions}

\item{max_trees}{An integer specifying the maximum number of trees to build. Default is 5.}

\item{max_depth}{An integer specifying the maximum depth of each tree. Default is 3.}

\item{epsilon}{A numeric value specifying the improvement threshold for early stopping. Default is 1e-4.}
}
\value{
A list containing the final Lasso model and the logic trees used in the model.
}
\description{
This function iteratively builds decision trees to optimize the F1 score, extracts paths as features,
and fits a Lasso model. The process is repeated for a specified number of trees, updating the model
and removing used features at each iteration.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'df' is your data frame and 'AGO_PR' is your outcome variable
columns <- colnames(df)[grep("^KRFP", colnames(df))]
result <- LogicHAL(df, "outcome", max_trees = 5, max_depth = 3)
print(result$model)
print(result$trees)
}
